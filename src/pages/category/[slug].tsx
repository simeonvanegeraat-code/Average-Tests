      <h3>Average savings and net wealth by age and region</h3>
      <p>
        On this page youâ€™ll find <strong>average monthly savings</strong>, the{" "}
        <strong>median savings rate</strong>, and snapshots of <strong>net household wealth</strong>.
        We show both <em>mean</em> and <em>median</em> so you get a fair picture that isnâ€™t
        skewed by a few very high values.
      </p>
      <h4>Why this matters</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Compare typical monthly savings for your age group and region.</li>
        <li>See how a savings rate turns income into long-term net wealth.</li>
        <li>Understand why medians are useful when distributions are skewed.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Method and sources</h4>
      <p>
        Benchmarks are compiled from official statistics such as <strong>Eurostat</strong> (saving rate and income)
        and the <strong>ECB HFCS</strong> for wealth distributions. Monthly amounts are derived from saving rates and
        disposable income. Check the source link under each card for details.
